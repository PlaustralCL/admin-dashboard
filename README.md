# Admin Dashboard
An HTML/ CSS exercise to create an admin dashboard as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/intermediate-html-and-css/lessons/admin-dashboard). The main object was to practice using grid.

The dashboard is meant to be displayed on a desktop size monitor. It was not designed to be fully responsive or work well on mobile screens.
